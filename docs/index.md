# Creation Ledger

Creation Ledger is a simple way to capture what you're working on, track progress, and quickly remember where to pick things up again — using plain Obsidian notes.

## What This Does

Creation Ledger lets you quickly:
- Log what you worked on
- Mark its current status (Todo, in progress or done)
- Add a little context so Future You knows what was happening

Each entry becomes a regular note in your vault. Nothing is locked, hidden, or stored in a database.

## How It Works

Creation Ledger creates Markdown files that you can open, edit, and organize like any other note in Obsidian. Your activity notes are organized by date in a `CreationLedger/` folder.

## When to Use It

Creation Ledger is designed for people who:
- Work on multiple ideas or projects
- Frequently stop and restart work
- Want lightweight structure without turning notes into a rigid task system
